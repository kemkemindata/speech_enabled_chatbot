## Speech-Enabled Chatbot with Streamlit
This project is a Speech-Enabled Chatbot built using Streamlit and SpeechRecognition. 
The chatbot interacts with users either via text input or speech, converting spoken words into text and generating responses using a simple pattern-matching algorithm from NLTK. 
The chatbot is capable of recognizing patterns and responding with predefined messages.

## Features
-Speech recognition: Allows users to interact with the chatbot using voice commands.

-Text-based input: Provides an alternative for users to type questions.

-Predefined responses: The chatbot responds to a set of predefined patterns (e.g., jokes, greetings, and general inquiries).

-Real-time response: Displays responses to users' queries on the web interface.

-Simple UI: Uses Streamlit to create an easy-to-use interface with minimal setup.
